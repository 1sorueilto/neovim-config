neovim configuration for c++ development. The goal of this configuration is to have a fulfilling C++ working environment. My aim is to make init.vim easily portable. Currently, init.vim should work out of the box. If you want UltiSnips to work with the snippets provided in the repo, copy the UltiSnips folder next to your init.vim in ~/.config/nvim/ folder.
